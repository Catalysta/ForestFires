```{r}
#please run all chunks from EDA prior to running this document.

#Check VIF since data appears to present with high multicollinearity

#set up regression models

cts.pred<-forest6[,6:12]
q<-ncol(cts.pred)
r2k<-numeric(q)
for (i in 1:q){
  formula<-as.formula(paste(colnames(cts.pred)[i],"~."))
  model<-lm(formula,data = cts.pred)
  r2k[i]<-summary(model)$r.squared
}
vifk<-1/(1-r2k)
vifk #these actually don't look too bad (but not great either)

#regress DMC on DC
summary(lm(DMC~DC, dat=forest6))$r.squared #actually not too bad, ok to leave in.

#check cook's distances
cd<-cooks.distance(lm(Larea~.,dat=forest6))
which(cd>qf(0.5,ncol(forest6)+1,nrow(forest6)-ncol(forest6)-1)) #these also look fine

```

Since remaining diagnostics look OK, proceed with variable selection.

Since p is small, we enumerate full model space using `leaps` package.

```{r}
require(leaps)
y<-forest6$Larea
X<-forest6[,c(1:12,14:15)]
regsubsets.out=regsubsets(y ~ X,
			   data = as.data.frame(cbind(y,X)),
               nbest = 2,       # 2 best models for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive") # or "forward" for forward selection,
                                      # "backward" for backward elimination
regsubsets.out
sum.reg=summary(regsubsets.out)
sum.reg

```

`DMC` appears to be least important, while `month` and `day` appear to be important. R^2 is extremely low. This data simply does not seem to predict `Larea` very well.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
plot(regsubsets.out, scale = "r2", main = "R^2",cex.axis=2,cex.lab=2,cex=2)
plot(regsubsets.out, scale = "adjr2", main = "Adjusted R^2",cex.axis=2,cex.lab=2,cex=2)
plot(regsubsets.out, scale = "Cp", main = "Mallow's Cp",cex.axis=2,cex.lab=2,cex=2)
```

Subset the data to train the model, reserving 1/4 for validation
```{r}
set.seed(6950)
indices<-sample(1:270,202)
train<-forest6[indices,]
test<-forest6[-indices,]
```
