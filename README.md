# ForestFires
STAT 6950 project

Fernando Anorve Lopez and Christina Sousa

Final team project for graduate applied statistics course, exploring the Montesinho 
Forest fires data set available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires.
The goal is to predict the total burned area of forest fires in hectares using on-line
meteorological data.

This is considered to be a challenging data set and is often used to put various machine
learning methods to the test. Here we explored the data relying heavily on traditional
statistical methods such as logistic regression and multiple linear regression. By using
higher-order interaction terms of the provided predictors, we were able to beat the 
mean model and achieve somewhat impressive results given the nature of the prediction
problem.
